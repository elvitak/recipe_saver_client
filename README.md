### Desciption

Passion project to practice coding.  
My passion is not about recipes itself but making my life easier.  
Place where to save all recipes and adjust it to your needs. Some day there will be a button that generates a meal plan for a week and a shopping list.


### Setup

Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:elvitak/recipe_saver_client.git`
don't forget to run `yarn`
